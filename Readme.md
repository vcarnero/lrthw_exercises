This project is the exercises I did as
part of reading through Learn Ruby the 
Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw.

This work was done as a homework assignment
for the [Davinci Coders](http://www.davincicoders.com/)
class that I'm taking, titled "Building
the Toolbelt of a Junior Ruby on Rails 
Developer" taught by [Jason Noble](http://jasonnoble.org).


Questions:
What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
> The three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know: Reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences.

Please explain these three skills in your own words.
>Reading and writing is important because you have to be comfortable typing odd characters in source code. Typing code samples and getting them to run, being familiar with the names of symbols helps you with reading and writing a new language.
>Attention to detail is an important skill because paying attention to the tiniest details of your work will prevent ending up with bugs.
>Spotting differences is the ability to visually scan lines of code and notice differences/similarities between them.

Why do you need to not copy and paste?
>"NOT" copying and pasting simply trains your brain and you mind how to write,read and see code.

Why is Practice and Persistence important?
>Practice and Persistence is important because many experts say it takes time and practice to refine your art in programming. The beginning of learning anything new can be confusing and moving through this confusion with consistent action, effort and persistence will help you grow, learn and be a great programmer.
