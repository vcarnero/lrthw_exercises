Study Drills:

#When I wrote this program the first time I had a mistake, and Ruby told me about it like this:
```There are 100 cars available.
There are only 30 drivers available.
There will be 70 empty cars today.
ex4.rb:14: undefined local variable or method `carpool_capacity' for
```main:Object (NameError)

The error highlights that the variable 'carpool_capacity' has not been defined.

#I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?
using 4.0 isn't necessary, you get the same output but floating points add more accuracy to the calculations.

#Remember that 4.0 is a floating point number. It's just a number with a decimal point, and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is floating point.
Floating points require a decimal

#Write comments above each of the variable assignments.
reference ex4.rb

#Make sure you know what = is called (equals) and that it's making names for things.
(=) states/names variables, v=number[v equals number].
(==) is a conditional statement, v == number [v is equal to number]

#Try running ruby from the Terminal as a calculator like you did before and use variable names to do your calculations. Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.
